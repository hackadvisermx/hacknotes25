## Spying on Santa

Elf McSkidy was doing a regular sweep of Santa's workshop when he discovered a hardware implant! The implant has a web camera attached to a microprocessor and another chip. It seems like someone was planning something malicious... We must try to understand what this implant was trying to do! We will deal with the microprocessor and the web camera in future tasks; for now, let's try to uncover what that other chip is being used for.

The VM that we will use in this task takes approximately 8 minutes to start. We suggest that you start the machine now to have it ready by the time you get to the practical element of the task!  

### Learning Objectives

-   How data is sent via electrical wires in low-level hardware
-   Hardware communication protocols
-   How to analyse hardware communication protocols
-   Reading USART data from a logic capture

## **USART**

Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (USART) communication, or as it is better known, serial communication, is a protocol that uses two wires. One wire is used to transmit (TX) data from device A to device B, and the other wire is used to receive (RX) data on device A from device B. In essence, we connect the transmit port from one device to the receive port from the other device and vice versa.

What is interesting about this protocol is that there is no clock line that synchronises the communication of the devices. Without a clock, the devices have to agree to the configuration of communication, such as the following:

-   Communication speed - This is also called the baud rate or bit rate and dictates how fast bytes of data can be sent. Agreeing to a specific rate tells each device how fast it should sample the data to get accurate communication. While there are fixed standards for baud rates, devices can choose to use any other rate as long as both devices support it.  
-   Bits per transmission - This is normally set to 8 bits which makes a byte, but it can be configured to something else, such as 16 bits.
-   Stop and Start bits - Since there is no clock, one device has to send a signal to the other device before it can send or end a data transmission. The configuration of the start and stop bits dictate how this is done.
-   Parity bits - Since there can be errors in the communication, parity bits can be used to detect and correct such errors in the transmission.

Once the two devices agree on the configuration of the serial lines, they can now communicate with each other. A single transmission is shown in the diagram below on how the ASCII character of "S" would be transmitted:

There are a couple of caveats, however. The devices don't really have a way to determine if the other device is ready for communication. To solve this, some USART connections will use two additional lines called Clear To Send (CTS) and Request to Send (RTS) to communicate to the other device whether it is ready to receive or ready to transmit. Furthermore, to agree upon what voltage level is a binary 1 or 0, a third wire called the Ground (GND) wire is required to allow the devices to have the same voltage reference.  

However, despite all of this, USART is an incredibly popular protocol in microprocessors due to its simplicity.

## **SPI**

The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol is mainly used for communication between microprocessors and small peripherals such as a sensor or an SD card. While USART communication has the clock built into the TX and RX lines, SPI uses a separate clock wire. Separating the clock (SCK) from the data (DATA) line allows for synchronous communication, which is faster and more reliable. So the trade-off is adding an additional wire, but we gain a speed and reliability boost. An example of the same "S" being transmitted using SPI is shown below:

The clock line tells the receiving device exactly when it needs to read the data line. Two-way communication is also possible, but quite a bit more complex than serial communication. Essentially, one of the devices is labelled the controller. This is the only device that is allowed to send clock signals. All other devices become secondary devices that must follow the controller's clock signal to transmit data back. If two-way communication is used, instead of having a single data line, two lines are used, namely Peripheral-In Controller-Out (PICO), which means communication is sent from the controller, and Peripheral-Out Controller-In (POCI), which means communication is sent from the secondary device back to the controller. Using this, the controller sends a clock signal and a command out to the device using the PICO line and then keeping the clock signal, the controller receives data back on the PICO line, as shown in the diagram below:

![[Pasted image 20221219201853.png]]
There is one additional change that can be made. While there can only be one controller, there can be multiple secondary devices. To save wires and ports, all devices can use the same SCK, PICO, and POCI lines. A fourth wire, called the Chip Select (CS) wire, is used to distinguish the device that the communication is meant for. The controller can use this line to indicate to the specific device that it wants to communicate to it, as shown in the diagram below:
![[Pasted image 20221219202004.png]]
SPI communication is a fair bit more complex than USART, but having a dedicated clock line increases the speed at which we can communicate and improves reliability.


## **I2C**

The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication protocol was created to deal with the drawbacks of both the USART and SPI communication protocols. Because USART is asynchronous and has the clock built into the transmit and receive lines, devices have to agree ahead of time on the configuration of communication. Furthermore, speeds are reduced to ensure communication remains reliable. On the other hand, while SPI is faster and more reliable, it requires many more wires for communication, and every single additional peripheral requires one more Chip Select wire.

I2C attempts to solve these problems. Similar to USART, I2C only makes use of two lines for communication. I2C uses a Serial Data (SDA) line and Serial Clock (SCL) line for communication. However, instead of using a Chip Select wire to determine which peripheral is being communicated to, I2C uses an Address signal that is sent on the SDA wire. This Address tells all controllers and peripherals which device is trying to communicate and to which device it is trying to communicate to. Once the signal is sent, a Data signal can be used to send the actual communication. To notify other controllers and peripherals that communication is taking place and prevent these devices from talking over each other, a Start and Stop signal is used. Each device can monitor these Start and Stop signals to determine if the lines are busy with communication. An example of such a data transmission is shown below:
![[Pasted image 20221219202102.png]]
Since an external clock line is used, communication is still faster and more reliable than USART, and while it is slightly slower than SPI, the use of the Address signal means up to 1008 devices can be connected to the same two lines and will be able to communicate. Now that we understand the basics of hardware communication protocols, we can look to analyse the logic of that rogue implant!
