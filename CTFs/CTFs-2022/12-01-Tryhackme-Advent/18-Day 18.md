# Task 23 [Day 18] Sigma Lumberjack Lenny Learns New Rules

## Threat Detection

Cyber threats and criminals have advanced tactics to ensure that they steal information and cause havoc.  What would be evident is that most of the blue-team activities will require proactive approaches to analysing different logs, malware and network traffic. This brings about the practice of threat detection.

Threat detection involves proactively pursuing and analysing abnormal activity within an ecosystem to identify malicious signs of compromise or intrusion within a network.

## Chopping Logs with Sigma Rules

Sigma is an open-source generic signature language developed by Florian Roth & Thomas Patzke to describe log events in a structured format. The format involves using a markup language called [YAML](http://yaml.org/), a designed syntax that allows for quick sharing of detection methods by security analysts. The common factors to note about YAML files include the following:
-   YAML is case-sensitive.
-   Files should have the `.yml` extension.
-   Spaces are used for indentation and not tabs.
-   Comments are attributed using the `#` character.
-   Key-value pairs are denoted using the colon `:` character.
-   Array elements are denoted using the dash `-` character.

Sigma makes it easy to perform content matching based on collected logs to raise threat alerts for analysts to investigate. Log files are usually collected and stored in a database or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution for further analysis. Sigma is vendor-agnostic; therefore, the rules can be converted to a format that fits the target SIEM.

Sigma was developed to satisfy the following scenarios:

-   To make detection methods and signatures shareable alongside IOCs and Yara rules.
-   To write SIEM searches that avoid vendor lock-in.
-   To share signatures with threat intelligence communities.
-   To write custom detection rules for malicious behaviour based on specific conditions.
