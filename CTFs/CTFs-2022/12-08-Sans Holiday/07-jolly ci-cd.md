Greetings Noble Player, 

Many thanks for answering our desperate cry for help!

You may have heard that some evil Sporcs have opened up a web-store selling 
counterfeit banners and flags of the many noble houses found in the land of 
the North! They have leveraged some dastardly technology to power their 
storefront, and this technology is known as PHP! 

***gasp*** 

This strorefront utilizes a truly despicable amount of resources to keep the 
website up. And there is only a certain type of Christmas Magic capable of 
powering such a thingâ€¦ an Elfen Ring!

Along with PHP there is something new we've not yet seen in our land. 
A technology called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment! 

Be wary! 

Many fair elves have suffered greatly but in doing so, they've managed to 
secure you a persistent connection on an internal network. 

BTW take excellent notes! 

Should you lose your connection or be discovered and evicted the 
elves can work to re-establish persistence. In fact, the sound off fans
and the sag in lighting tells me all the systems are booting up again right now.  

Please, for the sake of our Holiday help us recover the Ring and save Christmas!
