# Practice For School

## Objetivo
I think it's a ~~great~~ terrible idea to get practice with some exploits you ~~can~~ absolutely should never use on school assignments. Join my Edpuzzle class using the given link and complete the only assignment there (it's called "flag{???????}"). [www.edpuzzle.com/open/disvact](https://www.edpuzzle.com/open/disvact) Note: the video is 168 hours (1 week) long so you will not be able to watch through the whole thing. :)
