## Solve

```
https://uscybercombine-s4-spreading-out.chals.io/robots.txt

1/5: SIVBGR{ARIA_1s

```

```
2/5 en 
```

```
https://uscybercombine-s4-spreading-out.chals.io/readme

3/5: _4lw4ys_4nd
```

```
https://uscybercombine-s4-spreading-out.chals.io/sitemap.xml
4/5: _c4nnot_b3
```

## Solve after
```
1/5: SIVBGR{ARIA_1s (`robots.txt)` 
2/5: _spreading_3v3rywh3r3 (`.env`) 
3/5: _4lw4ys_4nd (`readme`)
4/5: _c4nnot_b3(`sitemap.xml`)

I could not for the life of me find part 5 so I just guessed a lot until I got this: 5/5: _st0pp3d} (`?`)
