Its type and form, in whispers, spoken.  
From reindeers' leaps to the elfish toast,  
Might the secret be in an ASREP roast?

`hashcat`, your reindeer, so spry and true,  
Will leap through hashes, bringing answers to you.  
But heed this advice to temper your pace,  
`-w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1`, just in case.

For within this quest, speed isn't the key,  
Patience and thought will set the answers free.  
So include these flags, let your command be slow,  
And watch as the right solutions begin to show.

For hints on the hash, when you feel quite adrift,  
This festive link, your spirits, will lift:  
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

And when in doubt of `hashcat`'s might,  
The CLI docs will guide you right:  
https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat

Once you've cracked it, with joy and glee so raw,  
Run /bin/runtoanswer, without a flaw.  
Submit the password for Alabaster Snowball,  
Only then can you claim the prize, the best of all.

So light up your terminal, with commands so grand,  
Crack the code, with `hashcat` in hand!  
Merry Cracking to each, by the pixelated moon's light,  
May your hashes be merry, and your codes so right!
