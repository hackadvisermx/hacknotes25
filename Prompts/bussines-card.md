```
A close-up shot of a hand holding a business card designed to look like a {file_format} file open in {code_editor}. The card shows code formatted in {syntax_type} with keys like {key1}, {key2}, {key3}, and {key4}. The window includes typical toolbar icons and a title bar labeled {file_name}, styled exactly like the interface of {code_editor}. Background is slightly blurred, keeping the focus on the card.

Example placeholders:

{file_format}: JSON, XML, YAML

{code_editor}: Notepad++, VS Code

{syntax_type}: JSON, XML

{key1}: "name": "Your Name"

{key2}: "title": "Your Title"

{key3}: "email": "your@email.com"

{key4}: "link": "yourwebsite"

[{key5}: "phone": "Phone Number"]

{file_name}: Business Card.json or Business Card.xml
```
