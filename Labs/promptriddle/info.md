Welcome to Prompt Riddle!  
This is a pretty hard puzzle-solving game, can you beat it?  
Your goal is to reach the next page by discovering the password for each level.  
If you accept the challenge, follow the instructions and good luck.  
  
Instructions:  
  
1. Even though the website has a 'hackish' theme, no prior knowledge about programming is necessary.  
2. All passwords are real words written in lowercase.  
3. If you are logged in, additional features will be available. Your name will appear in the terminal, your progress will be saved, you will be able to go to any previous level easily and you will be ranked in our leaderboard.  
4. Click the 'Sign Up' button to register or the 'Login' button if you already have an account.  
5. Do not cheat, you may find answers for the levels on the internet, but there is absolutely no point in trying to beat the game if you did not solve the riddles.  
6. Some levels may require external knowledge. Feel free to use google to learn things you think would be necessary to solve the level (BUT DON'T FORGET #5). If you use google, consider adding "-prompt -promptriddle" to your query so you can avoid spoilers.  
7. Some levels may require external tools like gimp/photoshop for images or audacity for audio.  
8. Type 'help' in the command prompt to discover what you can do in this terminal.  
  
If you enjoy the game, please consider donating. Have fun!
