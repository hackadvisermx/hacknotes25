The OPSEC process has five steps:

1.  Identify critical information
2.  Analyse threats
3.  Analyse vulnerabilities
4.  Assess risks
5.  Apply appropriate countermeasures

## Critical Information Identification

## Threat Analysis
1.  Who is the adversary?
2.  What are the adversaryâ€™s goals?
3.  What tactics, techniques, and procedures does the adversary use?
4.  What critical information has the adversary obtained, if any?
