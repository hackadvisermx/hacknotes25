## Windows Scripting Host (WSH)
Windows scripting host is a built-in Windows administration tool that runs batch files to automate and manage tasks within the operating system.

## An HTML Application (HTA)
HTA stands for “HTML Application.” It allows you to create a downloadable file that takes all the information regarding how it is displayed and rendered. HTML Applications, also known as HTAs, which are dynamic HTML pages containing JScript and VBScript. The LOLBINS (Living-of-the-land Binaries) tool mshta is used to execute HTA files. It can be executed by itself or automatically from Internet Explorer.

## Visual Basic for Application (VBA)
VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications, a programming language by Microsoft implemented for Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc. VBA programming allows automating tasks of nearly every keyboard and mouse interaction between a user and Microsoft Office applications.

## PowerShell (PSH)

PowerShell is an object-oriented programming language executed from the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) in .NET with some exceptions for legacy uses. Check out the TryHackMe room, [Hacking with PowerShell for more information about PowerShell](https://tryhackme.com/room/powershell).


## Command And Control - (C2 Or C&C)
C2 frameworks are post-exploitation frameworks that allow red teamers to collaborate and control compromised machines. C2 is considered one of the most important tools for red teamers during offensive cyber operations. C2 frameworks provide fast and straightforward approaches to:
-   Generate various malicious payloads
-   Enumerate the compromised machine/networks
-   Perform privilege escalation and pivoting
-   Lateral movement 
-   And many others
Some popular C2 frameworks that we'll briefly highlight are Cobalt Strike, PowerShell Empire, Metasploit. Most of these frameworks aim to support a convenient environment to share and communicate between red team operations once the initial access is gained to a system.

### Cobalt Strike
Cobalt Strike is a commercial framework that focuses on Adversary Simulations and Red Team Operations. It is a combination of remote access tools, post-exploitation capabilities, and a unique reporting system. It provides an agent with advanced techniques to establish covert communications and perform various operations, including key-logging, files upload and download, VPN deployment, privilege escalation techniques, mimikatz, port scanning, and the most advanced lateral movements.

### PowerShell Empire
PowerShell Empire is an open-source framework that helps red team operators and pen testers collaborate across multiple servers using keys and shared passwords. It is an exploitation framework based on PowerShell and Python agents. PowerShell Empire focuses on client-side and post-exploitation of Windows and Active Directory environment.  

### Metasploit 
Metasploit is a widely used exploitation framework that offers various techniques and tools to perform hacking easily. It is an open-source framework and is considered one of the primary tools for pentesting and red team operations. Metasploit is one of the tools we use in this room to generate payload for our weaponization stage.
